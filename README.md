# rebus mine

A new take on the classic minesweeper game dynamic where grids are cleared to reveal a rebus.  Players can either solve the rebus to expose the mines & win continue clicking on the grid without hitting a mine.

Game opens with “block text” appearing in the minefield grid
alongside a start button.

Players take turns clicking on the grid to expose mines and may enter the rebus solution in the provided        
text-box at any time.
